One Reddit user notes that Joplin is simple to use but misses several critical functionalities that make it a well-rounded note-taking application. The user feels that Obsidian is more modern, making it more popular.

Another Redditor agrees that Obsidian is better, especially with its library of plug-ins. However, the user points out that the loading time could be better compared to Joplin.
